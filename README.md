## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Data Ingestion & GCP BigQuery
* **Source**: Raw data files (e.g., CSV datasets from Kaggle).
* **Load Pattern**: ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline moving raw files directly into Google Cloud storage layers.
* **Storage**: Google BigQuery organized into **Ingestion** and **Staging** layers.

### 2. dbt Modeling & Star Schema
* **Tool**: `dbt` (data build tool).
* **Data Mart Structure**: Dimensional modeling implementing a **Star Schema**:
  * **Dimensions**: `dim_customers`, `dim_product`
  * **Facts**: `fact_orders`, `fact_order_items`
* **Metrics/Aggregations**: Business logic evaluation (e.g., performance metrics tracking).

### 3. Data Quality Testing
* **Tool**: Great Expectations.
* **Assertions & Validations**:
  * `Is Not Null` — **PASS**
  * `Assert Type Match` — **PASS**

### 4. Python Analysis & Visualization
* **Stack**: Python + `matplotlib`.
* **Output**: Dashboards, charts, and visual reporting derived from clean, tested data marts.

#### Pareto (80/20 Rule) in Analytics
* **Application**: Identify the vital few drivers of business value (e.g., top 20% of products driving 80% of revenue from `fact_order_items`).
* **Python Implementation**: Group data by SKU/customer dimensions, compute cumulative sum percentages, and plot Pareto Lorenz curves using `matplotlib` dual-axis charts (`bar` for individual contribution, `line` for cumulative percentage).
* **Decision Impact**: Prioritize inventory optimization, marketing spend, or quality alerts on the high-impact segment.

#### Diffusion of Innovation in Analytics
* **Application**: Segment user adoption or feature rollout velocity over time across customer cohorts (`dim_customers`).
* **Python Implementation**: Track cumulative adoption curves (innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards) using time-series aggregations and derivative velocity plots (S-curve fitting with `scipy.optimize` and `matplotlib`).
* **Decision Impact**: Determine inflection points for scaling product feature releases or adjusting customer success interventions.

## 👥 Team & Roles

This project was delivered by a five-member team as part of the NTU SCTP Advanced Professional Certificate in Data Science & AI (Module 2).

| Member | Role | Key Contributions |
|---|---|---|
| Gina | **Data Ingestion & GCP Setup** | Ingested raw Kaggle CSV sources into BigQuery raw and staging datasets; configured the GCP project and data loading. |
| Jamie | **dbt Modeling & Star Schema** | Designed and built the dimensional model in dbt: dimensions (`dim_customers`, `dim_products`) and facts (`fct_orders`, `fct_order_items`). |
| Ajmal | **Data Quality & Testing** | Implemented Great Expectations and dbt data tests (`not_null`, `unique`, referential integrity) to validate the warehouse layer. |
| Michael Liew | **Python Analysis & Visualizations** | Connected to BigQuery via SQLAlchemy/Pandas to analyse the modelled data: monthly sales trends, RFM customer segmentation and product performance. Produced the project's key findings: the **Pareto analysis** of revenue concentration (matplotlib/seaborn) and **Monthly Category Revenue Trends (MoM growth)** comparing the Top 5 vs Bottom 5 categories. |
| Steiner | **Documentation & Presentation Lead** | Created the architecture and data-flow diagrams (Draw.io) and led the executive presentation deck. |
